#Lecture 3: Security Tactics & Encryption 

##Review


##What are we securing? 
* Network - series of computers that are connected together for the purpose of sharing resources and data 
* Host - individual system on a network 
* Internet - series of interconnected networks that spans the entire world 

##Host Security 
* Operating system - base software on a system that manages the system's resources for the user and programs

##Security Tactics 
* **Least Access Principle** - making sure that someone only has access to what they need and nothing else 
* **Layered Security**
	* Having multiple layers of security 
	* Ex: Bank that has a guard, a safe, and an alarm system 
* **Diversity of defense** 
	* Use different vendors and tactics 
	* Ex: Having 2 firewall vendors 
* **Security through obscurity**
	* Put your important data somewhere other than My Documents 
* **Keep it simple** 
	* Do not have a server perform more than 1 task, keep the tasks of the servers separated 
* **Access Control** - controlling the permissions of an individual
