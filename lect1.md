#Lecture 1: Introduction 

##History of Information Security 
* 1960's - DoD’s Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) started what we refer to today as the "internet" within the military to exchange information 
* MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) was the first operating system created with security as its goal -­ now obsolete
* UNIX -­ primary purpose was text processing and had less security
* 1990's - computers were connected through LANs (Local Access Network) 


##Cyberattacks Today 
* In 2011, RSA was breached 
* 2013 Target was attacked 
* 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment was Hacked 
* 2015 Anthem Blue Cross was hacked 


* **Security** - freedom from care, anxiety or doubt; well founded confidence 
	* something that secures or makes safe; protection; defense; freedom from danger 
	* Precaution taken to guard against crime, attack, sabotage, espionage etc.  

Types of Security: 

* Physical security 
* Operations security 
* Communication Security 
* Network Security 
* Information Security 

**Information security** - protection of information & critical elements 

* Doesn't really generate any revenue or reduce any cost 
* It cannot guarantee security 

##Breach Summary 
* Breaches are normally detected in 49 - 80 days 
* Breaches are often detected by an outsider first
* On average it takes 83-123 days to respond to a breach 
* Average security breaches cost $32,469 per day before it gets resolved 

##Aspects of Security 
* CIA Triangle 
	* **Confidentiality** - only those that should have access will be able to have access to the information 
		* On a need to know basis 
		* Access control
	* **Integrity** - being whole, complete, or uncorrupted 
		* 2 Mechanisms: 
			* ***Prevention*** - blocking unauthorized attempts to change data 
			* ***Detection*** - reporting the changes in data 
	* **Availability** - enables the user to access information without interference 
		* Denial of Service attacks 
* **Privacy** - information that is collected, used, and stored by an organization that is intended only for the purposes stated to the data owner at the time it was collected 
* **Identification** - when a system is able to recognize individual users 
* **Authentication** - when a control provides proof that a user possess identity that he or she claims 
* **Authorization** - assurance that the user has been specifically and explicitly authorized by the proper authority to access, update, or delete the contents of an information asset 
* **Accountability** - when a control provides assurance that every activity undertaken can be attributed to named a person or automated process 

##Threat vs. Attacks 

* **Threat** - potential violation of security 
	* Doesn't have to already have happened 
	* 4 major categories: 
		* __*Disclosure*__ - unauthorized access of information 
		* ***Deception*** - accepting of false data 
		* ***Disruption*** - interruption or prevention of correct operations 
		* ***Usurpation*** - unauthorized control of some part of the system 
	* 	Examples: Snooping (wire tapping), modification, spoofing, delay, denial of service (dos) 
* **Attack** - actions that take advantage of potential threats  	

##Goals of Security 
* **Prevention** - stop the attack from happening 
* **Detection** - know when the attack is happening 
* **Recovery** - stop, assess, repair, and maintain functionality during the attack

##How do attackers gain access? 
* Vulnerabilities
	* Technical vulnerabilities 
		*  Use secure software, make sure to check for updates, and vulnerability 
	*  Human vulnerabilities 
		*  Cybersecurity training including social engineering 
	*  Operational/Managerial vulnerabilities
