PII - personal Identity information

## Golden Rules of Digital Forensics 
1. Protect & preserve the evidence 
	* It has to be an **exact** duplicate 
2. Assume that the case will go to court 
	* Can't turn on the computer/device because it will be the last time that you turned on the device instead of when the suspect/person might have last turned it on 
3. 

## Digital Forensic Imaging 
* Forensic preservation must be conducted on the digital media 
	* **Exact** copy must be made of the original digital media (also called best evidence)
