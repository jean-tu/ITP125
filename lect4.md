#Lecture 4: Networking Basics 

##Topologies 
* **Physical topology** - way physical components of the network are arranged (how we humans see the network) 
* **Logical topology** - how hosts on the network interact with each other 

**Bus Topology**

- Every component is connected to a single line with "taps" for each component 
- ADvantages: quick to deploy & cheap 
- Disadvantage: lots of collisions, unreliable, a break causes the rest of the network to fail

**Ring Topology**
- Every component has 2 connections (a left and a right) 
- Like the bus topology, but there is a connection going back to the front 
- Disadvantage: performance is poor, it's not easy to scale, and a break in one connection causes the network to fail
