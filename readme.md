#ITP 125: From Hackers to CEO's

###What is this?
This is just going to be a folder that will hold the information that I have learned from taking my ITP 125 course. It's the first stepping stone into my applied cybersecurity minor.

Mainly just making notes, so that I'll be able to find things easier in the future if I feel like I need to make reference to them.

The **index.md** file is the one that will be serving as the table of contents to be able to stay more organized and find things a bit easier.
