# Lecture 8: Social Engineering 

* Basic Human Tendencies 
	* **Reciprocity** - try to repay what another person has given to you 
	* **Social** proof - when uncertain, follow the lead of others 
	* **Consistency** - be consistent in your beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors 
	* **Cognitive dissonance** - uncomfortable tension resulting from holding two conflicting thoughts at the same time 
	* **Scarcity** - the less available something is, the more valuable it is 
	* **Liking** - complying with people we like 
	* **Authority** - complying with authority figures 

##Telltale Signs 
* Pretends to know some publicly available information about you 
	* When there is a stranger that says that they know a friend of yours or that they know where you go to school or something like that 
* Will try to warn you/induce fear 
* Will promise unrealistic outcome 
	* Making money for doing nothing 
* Time sensitivity/urgency 
	* Malware 
* Provide information meant to appear official but not verified 
	* Someone pretending to be the IRS    

##Social Engineering Playbook 
* Research - gather as much information on the victim/pool 
* Hook - attacker will make initial move to contact the victim and begin a script 
* Play - build the **TRUST** to find out additional information about them 
	* The more risky the information, the more trust you will need to have 
* Exit - end the communication without arousing suspicion
