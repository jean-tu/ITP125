#Lecture 9: Enterprise Security 

##Lollipop Model 
* Perimeter security - building virtual walls around everything of value 
* But there are no levels of security 
* Once someone has figured out how to get through, then they have access to everything 

##Onion Model 
* The layered security architecture must be peeled away by an attacker 
* **Rings of Trust** 
	* Some communications are to be trusted completely, others not so much, and some not at all 
	* You categorize the assets & users into how trustworthy they are, then put security controls around each area 
	* As you move in closer, you trust each other more 
	* Access Control Lists (ACLs) 

	
* Remove unnecessary hardware b/c of the drivers, the drivers don't get updates 
* Rename the Administrator account and give it a strong password 
	* The person would only have to guess the password 
* Remove unused user accounts 
* User anti-virus b/c it's better than not using it at all 
* Use a software firewall b/c it will help block out the ones that are harmful and alert you 
* Keep the oS patched and up to date 
	* B/c they have patches to security vulnerabilities 
* Keep all apps up to date b/c of the same reason 
* Use encryption - b/c if your data gets physically stolen, they won't be able to physically look at your data 
* Perform routine backups - in case you loose your data, incase you loose your integrity (corrupted or changed)  

**What else might you want to secure on a business environment?** 

* Disable the USB/CD device from booting --> Ophcrack 
* Enforce a passwords policy 
* Content filtering 
	* Whitelisting  
*
